# Note:<br/>
* This project needs to run approximate six hours due to the linear search for constructing weak classifiers.

* You need to modify the flags in the code so that you can save some intermediate results first, and then load to use them later. In this way, you can implement this project more efficiently.

* This project is used for a better understanding of adaboost. If you want to detect the faces fast and accurate, I would recommend [Mask_RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) for you
